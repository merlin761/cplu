1)Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. for this project i had to read datas and convert the temp from Fahrenheit to Celcius. 2)What did you do particularly well? i di a very well job creating a code that reads the text files. 3)Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? i think where i did poorly was when it came to use doubles and floats as well i didnt put decimal placess for i could improve on that. 4) Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? i think the most challenging pice of code was making sure that the code was going using the text file at the begging i was having issues with it. i had to read as well watch videos on how make the text file open. 5)What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? everything i did on this project and ooncn this class i will need it for my next classses as well in the future every little feedback and pice of code i did. 6)How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? i had to make sure the code was something easy and if i had a issue i could know whhere the issue was something i was comfortable doing.
